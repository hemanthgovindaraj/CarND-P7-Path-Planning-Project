# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Rubric points

### Compilation

The code compiles without error.

### Trajectory

#### Incident free movement
The car was able to drive continuously without any incidents. I checked until 9 miles ie approximately 2 laps and it was able to drive without any incidents.

#### Follows Speed limit
Maximum speed was always 49.5 Mph and the vehicle doesnt exceed the limit. With traffic situations, it slows down and recovers again to the maximum speed.

#### Maximum Acceleration and Jerk
The maximum acceleration was around 3 m/s2 and deceleration was around -5 m/s2 at high traffic situation. The jerk did not exceed -2m/s3.
The interesting part was when the vehicle actually performed a double lane shift and still had a small lateral acceleration and jerk. Spline  was used as suggested and it indeed gave a good result.

#### Collisions avoided
The criteria for lane change was kept as vehicles not present in a range of +/-30m and it helped with performing cautious lane changes.
The deceleration was also kept at an optimum value such that when the vehicle is detected at a distance of 30, the vehicle decelerates in time to avoid collision.

#### Lane Keeping
The car always stays in the lane and with the help of spline, the lane change also did not take much time.

#### Lane changes
Lane changes were really smooth with very little jerk and it was good even when the vehicle performed a double shift of lanes.

### Designing of Path planner

I started off with the spline suggestion made in the QA video for trajectory generation and it turned out to be a really effective technique. With an environment like the highway in the project, the spline seems to have an advantage over the JMT technique.The trajectory generation can be seen in line 204-291 in main.cpp.
Then i started with a prediction part to look at the other vehicles. With the highway environment, i was able to perform a simple range check using the sensor fusion data.I went through each vehicle in the time instant to detect the vehicle in the +/-30 range. I used a flag to trigger a lane change when the vehicle at the front was close.This can be seen in lines 117-168 of main.cpp
For the behavior planning part , i used a simple 3 states model with keep lane, lane change left and lane change right. Using the flag and the information of whether there is a vehicle on the left and right, i requested the lane change to left and right accordingly. This part can be seen in the lines 170-202 of main.cpp.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```


#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.
